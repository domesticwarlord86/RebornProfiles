# Sightsee-Profiles
Orderbot Profiles to complete sightseeing log

I've manually watched and adjusted each spot and should run good.

They are seperated into files by the tab number they show up in the sightseeing log. Make sure you have 9 tabs, meaning you got the HW,SB,SHB quests to do them...I have checks to try and get the HW and SB quests but since I already had the quests I couldn't test it.

ARR Sightseeing logs are missing, as most of them require timed conditions.

Heavensward: Done but missing 2 spots due to navigation limitations.
